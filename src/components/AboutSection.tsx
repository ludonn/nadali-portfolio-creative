          You know that kind of person who gets as excited about innovation as they do about a good pizza? Well, that's me!

          I'm a curious person who enthusiastically explores different fields: from smart city projects to IoT products. I started in the wellness sector creating innovative business models, and now I work at the University of Padua's foundation where I face new technological challenges every day.

          I firmly believe that progress comes from solutions built around our needs. My latest formal education is a Master's in Strategy Innovation, where I learned to develop strategies that don't simply follow the market, but reinvent it.
